"This is an introductory tutorial to TVM Operator Inventory (TOPI). TOPI "
"provides numpy-style generic operations and schedules with higher "

"However, for such a common operation we had to define the reduce axis "

"Imagine for more complicated operations how much details we need to "

":code:`topi.sum` much like :code:`numpy.sum`"

"Up to now, we have seen an example of how TOPI can save us from writing "

" we did the scheduling as before. TOPI also provides higher level "
